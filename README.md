# **Python projects**

The idea behind these is to get a lot more proficient with python programing to the point where it is a second language

In the repo so far we have;

**Guessing game**
Where we the number to be guessed is between 1-1000
It is sort of a play on search algorithms.
The script is going to tell you if the number you have guessed is too high or too low until you get the right number.

**Hangman**
Basically another guessing game (not too advanced right now)
The script will let you know whether the letter you have chosen is either - Already used - The right one - The wrong one
No GUI, it is all terminal based

**Madlib**
Who doesn't line something that would just randomly create a story?
This script is really simple, taking in the data that a user inputs and then printing that data out through the madlib variable.

**Rock-Paper-Scissors**
This script takes in data that the user will provide; - r = rock - p = paper - s = scissors
and gives its own response. It is based off of the random library that is imported at the top.
