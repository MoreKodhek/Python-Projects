# **Creating a simple slot machine**

The idea behind this project is to practice on some more advanced concepts of Python
We need to import random to help out with the random selection of the symbols
The code will also require the user to input data, the data that is being requested is in the form of integers, but there is string to integer conversion and confirmation that has already been added.
